The primary focus of my research revolves around the transformation of novel designs or concepts into practical robotic systems, aiming to create a tangible impact in our daily lives. These systems encompass crucial components such as actuators, sensors, and controllers. By harnessing creative designs or models, I strive to advance the performance, manipulability, and human-robot interaction of robots.

Anthropomorphic Robotic Finger Design (2023-)

Previous Projects (~2013)
======
A Balancing Bicycle
------

Based on the inverted-pendulum control, this bicycle can maintain its balance. On the back of the bicycle, there is a flywheel that makes inertia momentum. Using this flywheel data and the gyro data of the bicycle body, we can control the attitude of the bicycle theoretically through the simulation.

An Autonomous Vehicle
------

Using LIDAR sensor, this robot is able to detect obstacles so that avoid to head toward a fixed waypoint with a minimum distance while generating a local map.

An Anti-Collision Device for Automobile Doors
------

This work presents the electromagnetic locking system in an automobile door to prevent unexpected collision while opening.
