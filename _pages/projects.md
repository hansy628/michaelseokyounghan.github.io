The primary focus of my research revolves around the transformation of novel designs or concepts into practical robotic systems, aiming to create a tangible impact in our daily lives. These systems encompass crucial components such as actuators, sensors, and controllers. By harnessing creative designs or models, I strive to advance the performance, manipulability, and human-robot interaction of robots.

A tensegrity system is a highly flexible and balancing structure, which is made up of a rigid body and a tensile material. In this research, it is developed to explore an uncertain, rugged area by making its locomotion. Each actuator is connected to each side of tensegrity, which is the elastic spring component in this robot so that leads to deformation of the whole structure. However, in order to sustain its stability, it is necessary to keep a certain tendon force between on each vertext. Therefore, in this project, the dynamic analysis and system stability are presented to implement the robotic system. On top of that, the iterative learning control algorithm is applied for creating an improved performance of the robot. You can check "Locomotion of Three-Bar Tensegrity" video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nluj3a4f2s). 


# Previous Projects (~2013)

Below projects were presented from the local competition or contest exhibition.

## A Balancing Bicycle(right)
Based on the inverted-pendulum control, this bicycle can maintain its balance. 
On the back of the bicycle, there is a flywheel that makes inertia momentum. 
Using this flywheel data and the gyro data of the bicycle body, we can control the attitude of the bicycle theoretically through the simulation.

## An Autonomous Vehicle(middle)
Using LIDAR sensor, this robot is able to detect obstacles so that avoid to head toward a fixed waypoint with a minimum distance while generating a local map.

## An Anti-Collision Device for Automobile Doors(left)
This work presents the electromagnetic locking system in an automobile door to prevent unexpected collision while opening.
