The primary focus of my research revolves around the transformation of novel designs or concepts into practical robotic systems, aiming to create a tangible impact in our daily lives. These systems encompass crucial components such as actuators, sensors, and controllers. By harnessing creative designs or models, I strive to advance the performance, manipulability, and human-robot interaction of robots.
