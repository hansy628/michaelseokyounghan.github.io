I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Louisville. My current research interests predominantly lie within the realm of soft robotics. I find the field of bioinspired or biomimetic robotics particularly enticing, as nature's designs already showcase the pinnacle of engineering excellence. By drawing inspiration from natural designs, I aspire to explore and apply captivating models and designs that transcend not only biology but also other interdisciplinary fields without limitations.
Through my diverse range of experiences, I firmly believe in my ability to transform these visions into reality, creating original and practical robotic systems that can make a positive impact on the world.
