I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Louisville. Currently, I'm working on a biomimetic robotic system, which is inspired by human finger system to make a simplified motion and sensing mechanism. Previously, I've worked on developing a minimally invasive surgical robot at a startup company spun-off from the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, TX. During my master program, I created a novel design of Tensegrity robot, which can morph its shape so that makes locomotion in an exploring mission. 

I have one dog and one cat. I really love watching how nature works. And observing my dog and cat's physical motion and emotional changes is one of them. Since I've been interested in how robots can interact with surroundings so soft robotic and bio-inspired systems have infused life into my researches. 


<!-- A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html). -->
